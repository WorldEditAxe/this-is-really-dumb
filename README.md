## What is this?
A stupid little dumb project idea I had one day to have a public Linux instance.

## How does this work?
This project utilizes Docker to create a sandboxed instance of Ubuntu 20.04. Thanks to Docker's modularity, we can also run this pretty much everywhere. As such, the public instance (`terminal.q13x.com`) is ran on top of a free Render web service.
