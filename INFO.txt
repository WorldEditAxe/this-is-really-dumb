Hi there, welcome to your Open Terminal instance! The instance you're connected to runs
a minimal installation of Ubuntu 24.10 LTS. Each user is given basic Internet access to
facilitate some use cases requiring Internet access, but abuse is certainly not allowed.
(remember, other people use this site too!)

In addition to an Ubuntu install, we've installed some common CLI tools for your convenience,
including but not limited to:
- BusyBox
- build-essential (+ a couple of build tools, such as cmake)
- Node.js
- OpenSSL
- Nano (and Vim)
- ...and more!

NOTE: Turn off Dark Reader (and similar extensions) for this site, or the terminal window will
not automatically expand to fill the whole screen. Thank you!

==========================================
SWITCHING BETWEEN TOOL VERSIONS
==========================================
* Node.js: Run `nvm` in the terminal to change Node.js versions.
* Java: Run `jenv` in the terminal to change Java versions.
* Python 3: Run `pyenv` in  the terminal to change Python versions.
